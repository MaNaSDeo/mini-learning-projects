## Components

The application consists of the following components:

1. **App**: The main component that manages the state of the todos and handles pagination.
2. **TodoInput**: A component for adding new todos.
3. **Pagination**: A component for managing the pagination of the todos.
4. **TodoBox**: A component for displaying each todo item.
5. **TodoContextProvider**: A context provider for managing the state of the todos.

## Installation

To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MaNaSDeo/mini-learning-projects/tree/main/todo-list`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd todo-list`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage

After starting the application, you can add new todos using the input field. You can also edit and delete existing todos.

## Learning

This project is a great resource for learners to understand and practice several important concepts in React. Here's how:

1. **Understanding React Hooks**: This project uses several hooks such as `useState`, `useContext`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `useReducer`. By studying the code, learners can understand how these hooks work and how they can be used in a real-world application.

2. **Mastering the Context API**: The `TodoContextProvider` component uses the Context API to manage the state of the todos. This is a great example of how to use the Context API to manage global state in a React application.

3. **Implementing Pagination**: The `Pagination` component handles the pagination of the todos. This is a practical example of how to implement pagination in a React application.

4. **Building Custom Components**: The `TodoInput`, `TodoBox`, and `Pagination` components are custom components built for specific purposes. By studying these components, learners can understand how to build and use custom components in a React application.

5. **Managing Component State and Side Effects**: The use of `useState` and `useEffect` in the `TodoInput` and `TodoBox` components provides a good example of how to manage component state and side effects in a React application.

6. **Understanding Conditional Rendering**: The code includes several instances of conditional rendering. For example, the `TodoInput` component is conditionally rendered based on the `todoInputVisible` state.

By studying this project, learners can gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and improve their React skills. Happy learning! ðŸ˜Š
